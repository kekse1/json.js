# **`JSON`.js**
Just started this one as a really small JSON extension, implemented in **JavaScript**.

## Features
The `.json` files can now also:

* Contain **comments** `/* ... */`

* Beneath the **`"`** string literal now also supported **`'`** and **`\``'**
* This also holds for escaping 'em, it's also supported.
* All in keys and in values.

* *TODO***?**? maybe more features will come l8rs.. dunno.

## Example / Test
//**TODO**//(insert it here)

## Download
//**TODO**//(publish it here)

## //**TODO**//
... maybe more here? The project just started - first I want to test it better,
then, when uploading it, I'm also going to finish this page, too.
