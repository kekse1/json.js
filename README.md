# **`JSON`.js**
Just started this one as a really small JSON extension, implemented in **JavaScript**.

It's a **Pre-Processor**, not a Parser.

## Features
The `.json` files can now also:

* Contain **comments** `/* ... */`

* Beneath the **"** string literal now also supported **'** and **\`**
* This also holds for escaping 'em, it's also supported.
* All both in keys and in values.

* //**TODO??**?// maybe more features will come l8rs.. dunno.

## Download
* [Version **v0.2.4**](js/json.js) (updated **2024-07-12**)

## Example / Test
* [`first-tiny-test`.json](json/first-tiny-test.json)

## Details
I'm just parsing it 'byte by byte'. With one `open` state. That's all.

## More
I'd be happy if you'd send me your own ideas how to extend the JSON format.
